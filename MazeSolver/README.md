*SFML was used and is a separate library that I used. I did not create or have any part in creating SFML*

Make sure SFML is installed and working before compiling. These instructions are also under the assumption that you are using g++ to compile.
## To compile:
    1. open terminal (make sure you're in the right directory `cd MazeSolver`). 
    2. "make" or "mingw32-make" for windows.
    3. then type ".\mazeSolver.exe" and run it. 
The terminal will then prompt you to chose a maze number(1-12)(I would recommend 7 first) then it will ask you if you want to use BFS or DFS type in the searching algorithm you want. 
Once you pick one the application will immediately start solving the maze.
